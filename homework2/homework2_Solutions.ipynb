    "# Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to put into action the data manipulation techniques from the previous lab ([week 5](https://dslab2019.github.io/labs/week5/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are many of you working with the cluster, we encourage you to prototype your queries on small data samples before running them on whole datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hive queries: <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Select>\n",
    "Hive functions: <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Displaying results in Zeppelin\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this homework, many questions ask to retrieve and display data. You should do so by using Zeppelin functionality to display tables and plots. It is part of the exercises to find out which representations are the most releveant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I - Data from SBB/CFF/FFS (35 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data source: <https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/dataset/istdaten>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will leverage Hive to perform exploratory analysis of data published by the Open Data Platform Swiss Public Transport. (<https://opentransportdata.swiss>).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Format: the dataset is presented a collection of textfiles with fields separated by ';' (semi-colon). There is one file per day, ranging from 13.09.2017 until 31.01.2019. We will only use a subset of that and focus on the 2017 data. The textfiles have been compressed using bzip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Location: you can find the data on HDFS at the path `/datasets/sbb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the full description from opentransportdata.swiss is only provided in German (<https://opentransportdata.swiss/de/cookbook/ist-daten/>). You can use an automated translator to get more information, but here are the relevant column descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BETRIEBSTAG`: date of the trip\n",
    "- `FAHRT_BEZEICHNER`: identifies the trip\n",
    "- `BETREIBER_ABK`, `BETREIBER_NAME`: operator (name will contain the full name, e.g. Schweizerische Bundesbahnen for SBB)\n",
    "- `PRODUCT_ID`: type of transport, e.g. train, bus\n",
    "- `LINIEN_ID`: for trains, this is the train number\n",
    "- `LINIEN_TEXT`,`VERKEHRSMITTEL_TEXT`: for trains, the service type (IC, IR, RE, etc.)\n",
    "- `ZUSATZFAHRT_TF`: boolean, true if this is an additional trip (not part of the regular schedule)\n",
    "- `FAELLT_AUS_TF`: boolean, true if this trip failed (cancelled or not completed)\n",
    "- `HALTESTELLEN_NAME`: name of the stop\n",
    "- `ANKUNFTSZEIT`: arrival time at the stop according to schedule\n",
    "- `AN_PROGNOSE`: actual arrival time (when `AN_PROGNOSE_STATUS` is `GESCHAETZT`)\n",
    "- `AN_PROGNOSE_STATUS`: look only at lines when this is `GESCHAETZT`. This indicates that `AN_PROGNOSE` is the measured time of arrival.\n",
    "- `ABFAHRTSZEIT`: departure time at the stop according to schedule\n",
    "- `AB_PROGNOSE`: actual departure time (when `AB_PROGNOSE_STATUS` is `GESCHAETZT`)\n",
    "- `AB_PROGNOSE_STATUS`: look only at lines when this is `GESCHAETZT`. This indicates that `AB_PROGNOSE` is the measured time of arrival.\n",
    "- `DURCHFAHRT_TF`: boolean, true if the transport does not stop there\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the file represents a stop and contains arrival and departure times. When the stop is the start or end of a journey, the corresponding columns will be empty (`ANKUNFTSZEIT`/`ABFAHRTSZEIT`).\n",
    "In some cases, the actual times were not measured so the `AN_PROGNOSE_STATUS`/`AB_PROGNOSE_STATUS` will be empty or set to `PROGNOSE` and `AN_PROGNOSE`/`AB_PROGNOSE` will be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the repository you will also find the file `sbb_example.png` that shows how you can relate this dataset to the schedule you get from SBB's website."
