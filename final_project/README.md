# Final Project
This is our implementation for the robust route planning.
The organization of the repository is as follows:
- The main notebook showcasing our algorithm is `main.ipynb`
- Analysis and Precomputing can be found in the other notebooks with their respective title
    - `Heuristic.ipynb` for precomputing the heuristic
    - `Delay_Analysis.ipynb` for the statistical analysis of delays and fitting of the delay-distriubtion
    - `Walking.ipynb` for precomputing walking times
    - `Visualisation.ipynb` for showcasing the visualisation without having to run the algorithm
    - `Stations_Extract.ipynb` displays our method used for keeping stations in a 10km radius around ZÃ¼rich HB
- The various precomputation results can be found in the `data`-Folder
- The video of our presentation can be found under the name `presentation.mp4`. It can also be downloaded from GDrive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4StEQrILYhoS5nVaCCgCaFZ7gAY5Xno/view?usp=sharing "Download the Video from Google Drive")
