    "## Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "The search algorithm we decided to use is a modified version of the A* algorithm. If eta is the estimated arrival time of a path, then eta(n) = g(n) + E[d(n)] + h(n) with g(n) the predicted arrival time of the last connection, E[d(n)] the expected delay of the last trip and h(n) the heuristic estimating the time remanning to get from the nth stop to the arrival station. \n",
    "\n",
    "The priority queue is performed on eta. As the eta is always an overly optimistic estimation of the arrival time, no trip can ever perform better that the current lowest eta. Meaning that when the station with the lowest eta is the destination station we are assured that any further computed trip would take more time, and have therefore find the time optimal trip. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, the stop with the lowest eta is extracted from the priority queue and all states that can be reached from this point are computed. The states that are better that what we already found and have a higher probability to succeed that the threshold set by the user are added to the priority queue. The program stops when the destination station is the station extracted from the priority queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining a state**\n",
    "A state is defined by a station, an eta, the probability to be at the state and the arrival time of the trip that took us to that state. The eta is a very optimistic estimation of the arrival time. The actual arrival time will always we either equal or higher that the estimated arrival time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a state**\n",
    "When the nth state is \"poped\" from the priority list, a list of neighbouring stations and trip to get to them from the nth state station is computed. \n",
    "For each element of this list a new state is created :\n",
    "    - The new eta = (predicted arrival time to station n+1) + (expected delay from the trip from n to n+1) +  (heuristic at n+1) \n",
    "    - The probability of being at the state = Pboarding * P being at the nth state \n",
    "    - The P of boarding = probability that delay if the train taken to nth station arrives in time to take the train to the n+2 station. \n",
    "If the trip to the next station is by walking we set the eta as the current time + walking time + heuristic of the n+1 state and the P of boarding is set to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heursitic** \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Heuristic, we create a graph that contains as edge weights between nodes (stations) the fastest direct transport between them (walking if in range, train if there is a train-line connecting the 2 stations, no edge otherwise). We then precalculated the distance-matrix for this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability of delay of a train**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution of the delays of each trains is approximated by assuming that each sort of train (linien_text) have the same probability distribution function (pdf) at each stations. The pdf is estimated to be lognorm. Details of estimation of train delays are in the Delay Analysis notebook. To estimate the arrival time of a train we use the predicted arrival time + the expected delay.\n",

    "**Probability of boarding**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user takes *train 1* to station a and *train 2* to station b.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the probability to board *train 2* at station a, meaning the probability for *train 1* to arrive at station a before *train 2* leave the station. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here only arrival time of trains are random variable, whereas departure are set as deterministic values, to avoid to offer a plan counting on the late departure of a train. We also estimated that changing train takes around 3 minutes. This could be fine tuned by for exemple testing if the arrival platform is the same as the next departure platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of boarding *train 2* is therefore calculated as the probability that the *train 1* is delayed of less than the time between the predicted arrival of *train 1* and the departure of *train 2*.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Eliminating bad path**\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the number of visited path we keep track of the stations we already visited. A station that already as been visited by the algorithm can be considered again either if the subsequent estimated time  of arrival is better that the previous one or if the probability to successfully be at this stop is higher that the previous one. If either or both of the condition are met, the trip is added the priority queue. Otherwise we can ignore it. \n",
